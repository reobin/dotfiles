# Karabiner config

## Mappings

### Caps lock

The ``caps lock`` key is is mapped to the ``escape`` key on tap.\
When it is held down, it is mapped to the ``right control`` key.

### Vim arrow keys

When the ``right control`` key is held down (or the ``caps lock`` key),\
``h``, ``j``, ``k``, and ``l`` are mapped to arrow keys as defined by vim.

## Import the mappings in your config

The config files for karabiner are located at ``~/.config/karabiner/``.\
From there, you can replace the ``karabiner.json`` file with mine to import\
my mappings.

If you already have karabiner mappings you don't want to lose, you can import\
the standalone modifications in the ``assets/complex_modifications/`` directory.

When that is done, you can have a better view of the active modifications by\
opening the Karabiner-Elements app.
